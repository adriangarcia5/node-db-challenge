Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.
- Relational databases store data in tables, where SQL is the standard language used to manage those databases and their data.

Why do tables need a primary key?
- Primary keys are what gives each row/entry in a database a unique id

What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
- Foreign key :)

What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
- when adding a foreign key in the many side of the relationship that points to the primary key in the table that represents one side.
